"""Lint SECRET_PATTERNS drift across known consumers of molecule-core's canonical.

The canonical SECRET_PATTERNS array in
.github/workflows/secret-scan.yml is mirrored by every other side
that scans for credentials: the workspace-runtime's bundled
pre-commit hook, the molecule-controlplane inlined copy, etc. The
mirror is enforced socially today — when someone adds a new pattern
to canonical (e.g. the sk-cp- MiniMax token after F1088), the other
sides are supposed to be updated in lockstep.

This script automates the check. Diffs the canonical's pattern set
against each known public consumer and exits non-zero on any
mismatch. Wired into a daily cron + on-push gate via
.github/workflows/secret-pattern-drift.yml.

Private-repo consumers (currently molecule-controlplane's inlined
copy) are out of scope here because the molecule-core workflow's
GITHUB_TOKEN can't read other private repos in the org. They're
expected to self-monitor via their own copy of this script — not a
hard barrier, just a future expansion.
