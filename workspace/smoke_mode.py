"""Boot smoke mode — exercises the executor's full import tree without touching real platforms.

Why this exists (issue #2275): the existing `wheel_smoke.py` only IMPORTS
`molecule_runtime.main` at module scope. Lazy imports buried inside
`async def execute(...)` bodies (e.g. `from a2a.types import FilePart`)
NEVER evaluate at static-import time — they crash at first message
delivery in production.

The 2026-04-2x v0→v1 a2a-sdk migration shipped 5 such regressions in
templates that all looked fine at module-load smoke. This module fills
the gap by actually invoking `executor.execute(stub_ctx, stub_queue)`
once with a short timeout. If the import-tree is healthy the call
proceeds far enough to hit a network boundary (LLM call, etc.) and
times out — that's a *pass*. If a lazy import is broken, the call
raises `ImportError` / `ModuleNotFoundError` from inside the executor
body — that's a *fail*.

Activated by setting `MOLECULE_SMOKE_MODE=1` in the env. Wired into
`main.py` after `executor = await adapter.create_executor(...)` so the
full adapter setup path runs first; the smoke just adds one more
exercise step before exit.

CI usage (intended for `molecule-ci/.github/workflows/publish-template-image.yml`):
  docker run --rm \
    -e WORKSPACE_ID=fake -e MOLECULE_SMOKE_MODE=1 \
    "$IMAGE" molecule-runtime
