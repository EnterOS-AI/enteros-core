def _build_initialize_result() -> dict:

    Three fields together expose a dual-path inbound delivery contract
    so push UX works on hosts that support it and polling falls in
    cleanly everywhere else — universal by design, no per-client
    branching:

    1. ``capabilities.experimental.claude/channel`` — declares the
       Claude Code channel capability. When the host is Claude Code
       AND launched with ``--dangerously-load-development-channels``
       (or this server name is on Claude Code's approved allowlist),
       the MCP runtime registers a listener for our
       ``notifications/claude/channel`` emissions and routes them as
       inline ``<channel>`` conversation interrupts. When the host is
       any other MCP client (Cursor, Cline, opencode, hermes-agent,
       codex) or Claude Code without the flag, this capability is
       a no-op — the host simply ignores the notification method,
       and the poll path below carries the load.

    2. ``instructions`` — non-empty, describes BOTH delivery paths
       (push tag and poll-on-every-turn via ``wait_for_message``)
       converging on the same ``inbox_pop`` ack. The instructions
       field is read by every spec-compliant MCP client and surfaced
       to the agent's system prompt automatically, so the polling
       contract reaches every host without any per-client wiring.
       Required for the channel to be usable per
       code.claude.com/docs/en/channels-reference.md.

    3. ``protocolVersion`` — pinned to the version negotiated with
       Claude Code at task #46 implementation; bumping it changes
       what fields the host expects.

    Mirrors the contract used by the official telegram channel plugin
    (claude-plugins-official/telegram/server.ts:370-396) for the push
    half. The poll half is universal MCP — no client-specific
    extensions.

    Why both paths instead of picking one:
    - Push-only: silently regresses on every non-Claude-Code client
      and on standard Claude Code launches without the dev-channels
      flag (verified live 2026-05-01 — a canvas message landed in
      the inbox but never reached the agent loop until manual
      `inbox_peek`).
    - Poll-only: works everywhere but stalls 0–N seconds per turn
      even on hosts that could push. Push is strictly better when
      available.
    - Both: poll covers the floor universally; push promotes to
      zero-stall delivery when the host opts in. Same `inbox_pop`
      dedupes the race.

    """Synchronous wrapper around the async MCP stdio loop.

    Called by ``mcp_cli.main`` (the ``molecule-mcp`` console-script
    entry point in scripts/build_runtime_package.py) AFTER env
    validation and the standalone register + heartbeat thread setup.
    Direct callers (in-container code that already validated env and
    runs heartbeat.py separately) can also invoke this — it's the
    smallest possible "run the MCP stdio JSON-RPC loop" surface.

    Wheel-smoke gates in scripts/wheel_smoke.py pin the importability
    of this name (alongside ``mcp_cli.main``) so a silent rename can't
    break every external-runtime operator's MCP install — the 0.1.16
    ``main_sync`` rename incident is the cautionary precedent.
