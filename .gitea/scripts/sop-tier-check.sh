# sop-tier-check — verify a Gitea PR satisfies the §SOP-6 approval gate.
#
# Reads the PR's tier label, walks approving reviewers, and checks team
# membership against the tier's approval expression. Passes only when
# ALL clauses in the expression are satisfied by the set of approving
# reviewers (AND-composition; internal#189).
#
# Expression syntax:
#   "team-a"          — OR-set: any ONE of the comma-separated teams
#   "team-a AND team-b" — AND: BOTH must each have ≥1 approver
#   "(a,b,c)"         — OR-set wrapped in parens; same as "a,b,c"
#
# Example: "qa AND security AND (managers,ceo)" means:
#   ≥1 approver in team "qa"  AND
#   ≥1 approver in team "security"  AND
#   ≥1 approver in team "managers" OR "ceo"
#
# Per the spec (internal#189), the hard gate here pairs with the
# advisory gate of sop-conformance LLM-judge (internal#188): each
# required-team click must reflect real verification (visible in review
# body or A2A messages), not rubber-stamp APPROVE. Both gates together
# close the "teammate clicks APPROVE without verifying" gap.
#
# Invoked from `.gitea/workflows/sop-tier-check.yml`. The workflow sets
# the env vars below; this script does no IO outside of stdout/stderr +
# the Gitea API.
#
# Required env:
#   GITEA_TOKEN   — bot PAT with read:organization,read:user,
#                   read:issue,read:repository scopes
#   GITEA_HOST    — e.g. git.moleculesai.app
#   REPO          — owner/name (from github.repository)
#   PR_NUMBER     — int (from github.event.pull_request.number)
#   PR_AUTHOR     — login (from github.event.pull_request.user.login)
#
# Optional:
#   SOP_DEBUG=1        — print per-API-call diagnostic lines. Default: off.
#   SOP_LEGACY_CHECK=1 — revert to OR-gate (≥1 approver from any eligible
#                         team). Grace window for PRs in-flight when the
#                         new AND-composition was deployed. Expires 2026-05-17
#                         (7-day burn-in window; internal#189 Phase 1).
#                         Set by workflow for PRs merged before the deploy.
