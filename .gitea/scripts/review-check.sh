# review-check — evaluate whether a PR satisfies a single team-review gate.
#
# RFC#324 Step 1 of 5 — qa-review + security-review check workflows.
#
# This is the shared evaluator invoked by:
#   .gitea/workflows/qa-review.yml      (TEAM=qa,      TEAM_ID=20)
#   .gitea/workflows/security-review.yml (TEAM=security, TEAM_ID=21)
#
# Pass condition (per RFC#324 v1.1 addendum):
#   ≥ 1 review on the PR where:
#     • state == APPROVED
#     • review.dismissed == false
#     • review.official != false (excludes draft/mis-filed APPROVED reviews)
#     • review.user.login != PR.user.login (non-author)
#     • review.user.login ∈ team-members
#
# Strict mode (default OFF for v1; see RFC trade-off note):
#   If REVIEW_CHECK_STRICT=1, additionally require review.commit_id == PR.head.sha.
#   With dismiss_stale_reviews: true at the protection layer, stale reviews
#   are already dismissed, so the additional commit_id check is belt-and-
#   suspenders. Keeping it off in v1 simplifies semantics; flip in a follow-up
#   PR if reviewer telemetry shows residual stale-APPROVE merges.
#
# Privilege gate (RFC#324 v1.3 §A1.1 — INFORMATIONAL ONLY):
#   The /qa-recheck and /security-recheck slash-commands can be triggered
#   by anyone who can comment on the PR. The workflow's privilege step
#   logs collaborator-status but does NOT gate execution of this script.
#   Why this is safe: this evaluator is read-only and idempotent —
#   reading `pulls/{N}/reviews` and `teams/{id}/members/{u}` can't be
#   influenced by who triggered the run. If a real team-member APPROVE
#   exists the gate flips green; otherwise it stays red. A
#   non-collaborator commenting /qa-recheck cannot manufacture a green
#   gate. Original (v1.2) design with `if:`-gating of this step was
#   fail-open (skipped-via-`if:` job still publishes the status as
#   `success`) — corrected in v1.3 per hongming-pc review 1421.
#
# Trust boundary (RFC A4):
#   This script is loaded from the BASE branch (sourced via .gitea/scripts/
#   on the workflow's checkout-of-base). It does NOT execute any PR-HEAD
#   code. It only reads PR review state via the Gitea API.
#
# Token scope (RFC A1-α):
#   The job's own conclusion (exit 0 / exit 1) is what publishes the
#   `qa-review / approved` / `security-review / approved` status context.
#   NO `POST /statuses` call here → NO `write:repository` scope on the
#   token. `read:organization` (for team-membership probe) and
#   `read:repository` (for PR + reviews) are enough.
#
# Required env:
#   GITEA_TOKEN — least-priv read:repository + read:organization. See note
#                 below about the team-membership API requiring the token
#                 owner to be in the queried team (Gitea 1.22.6 quirk).
#   GITEA_HOST  — e.g. git.moleculesai.app
#   REPO        — owner/name (from github.repository)
#   PR_NUMBER   — int (from github.event.pull_request.number or
#                 github.event.issue.number for issue_comment events)
#   TEAM        — short team name (qa | security) for log lines
#   TEAM_ID     — Gitea team id (20=qa, 21=security at time of writing)
#
# Optional:
#   REVIEW_CHECK_DEBUG=1 — per-API-call diagnostic lines
#   REVIEW_CHECK_STRICT=1 — also require review.commit_id == pr.head.sha
#   DEFAULT_BRANCH=main — branch this gate protects; non-default-base PRs no-op
