# Measure platform-side bounds (or absence thereof) on a coordinator's
# task execution. Reproduction harness for Issue 4 of the 2026-04-28
# CP review, surfaced in the RFC at molecule-core#2251.
#
# What Issue 4 hypothesized
# -------------------------
# A coordinator workspace receives an A2A kickoff, delegates to children,
# then enters a synthesis phase whose duration the platform does not
# bound. `DELEGATION_TIMEOUT` (300s, in workspace/builtin_tools/
# delegation.py) governs the parent→child HTTP request, NOT the
# coordinator's own task-execution budget. So a coordinator that's
# spent 10min synthesizing past delegation will keep going until the
# LLM returns or its host runtime crashes — never bounded by a platform
# ceiling.
#
# Issue 4 explicitly hedged ("This isn't necessarily a platform bug —
# could be that the Design Director's system prompt told it to do
# complex synthesis work that exceeded the A2A response window"). This
# script is the empirical test of which side that ambiguity lands on.
#
# What this script does NOT do
# ----------------------------
# - It does NOT assert pass/fail. The "bug" is absence-of-bound, which
#   is hard to assert in a single run. The script outputs measurement
#   data; the team interprets.
# - It does NOT simulate a coordinator hang via runtime modification.
#   Instead, it drives a real coordinator with a synthesis-heavy task
#   and observes the duration the platform tolerates.
# - It does NOT clean up on failure. Use scripts/cleanup-rogue-workspaces.sh.
#
# What "bug confirmed" looks like (per Issue 4)
# ---------------------------------------------
#   coordinator_response_secs > 300 AND no platform_intervention=true
#   in the heartbeat trace → coordinator ran past DELEGATION_TIMEOUT
#   (HTTP-level) without any platform ceiling kicking in. The RFC's
#   V1.0 operator ceiling would convert this into an explicit
#   `terminated` response at MAX_TASK_EXECUTION_SECS.
#
# What "bug refuted" looks like
# -----------------------------
#   coordinator_response_secs cleanly bounded by either the LLM API
#   timeout or some other platform mechanism → Issue 4's premise that
#   "no platform-enforced timeout" is wrong, V1.0 of the RFC needs
#   re-justification.
#
# Usage
# -----
#   # local dev — no auth, no tenant scoping required:
#   PLATFORM=http://localhost:8080 OPENROUTER_API_KEY=... \
#     bash scripts/measure-coordinator-task-bounds.sh
#
#   # staging — explicit tenant + admin token are mandatory; the script
#   # refuses to run without them when PLATFORM is non-local:
#   PLATFORM=https://your-staging-tenant.example \
#   ADMIN_TOKEN=...           \
#   TENANT_ID=tenant-uuid     \
#   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...    \
#     bash scripts/measure-coordinator-task-bounds.sh
#
#   # dry-run — print plan + auth/scoping summary, exit before any
#   # state mutation. Use this before pointing at staging:
#   DRY_RUN=1 PLATFORM=... ADMIN_TOKEN=... TENANT_ID=... \
#   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=... \
#     bash scripts/measure-coordinator-task-bounds.sh
#
# Cleanup
# -------
#   The script deletes both workspaces it created on EXIT (success,
#   failure, or interrupt). Set KEEP_WORKSPACES=1 to skip cleanup when
#   you need to inspect the workspaces afterward — but remember to
#   delete them by hand or chain `cleanup-rogue-workspaces.sh`.

Auth:         $([ -n "$ADMIN_TOKEN" ] && echo "Bearer ***${ADMIN_TOKEN: -4}" || echo "<none — local dev>")

Would provision:
  PM (coordinator, tier=2, template=claude-code-default)
  Researcher (child, tier=2, template=langgraph)

Would send synthesis-heavy task: $SYNTHESIS_DEPTH delegations + 600w
synthesis. Coordinator A2A timeout: ${A2A_TIMEOUT}s.

Workspaces would be auto-deleted on script exit (override with
KEEP_WORKSPACES=1).

Re-run without DRY_RUN=1 to execute.

Interpretation guide:

  ELAPSED_SECS < 60   → Synthesis completed quickly; not informative
                        about platform bounds (LLM was just fast).
                        Re-run with SYNTHESIS_DEPTH=8 to force longer
                        synthesis.

  60 <= ELAPSED < 300 → Within DELEGATION_TIMEOUT. Doesn't prove or
                        refute Issue 4 — the HTTP-level timeout would
                        be sufficient if synthesis happened to fall
                        under it.

  ELAPSED >= 300      → BUG CONFIRMED IF heartbeat_trace shows no
                        platform-side transition. Coordinator ran past
                        DELEGATION_TIMEOUT without any platform ceiling
                        kicking in — exactly the gap the RFC V1.0 plans
                        to close with MAX_TASK_EXECUTION_SECS.

  curl_failed_or_timed_out → \$A2A_TIMEOUT exceeded. Either the
                        coordinator is genuinely hung (likely) or
                        synthesis is just very slow. Pull workspace
                        status separately to disambiguate.

Heartbeat trace caveats:

  If heartbeat_trace.raw is the literal string "<endpoint_unavailable>"
  the platform's /heartbeat-history endpoint is missing or 404'd; the
  measurement is INCONCLUSIVE on the bound question because we cannot
  observe whether a platform-side transition fired. Either wire the
  endpoint or replace this trace pull with an equivalent Datadog query
  for the workspace's heartbeat metric and re-run.
