// restartState coalesces concurrent RestartByID calls for one workspace.
//
// The naive "one mutex per workspace, TryLock+drop" pattern caused a real
// data-loss bug: SetSecret + SetModel both fire `go restartFunc(...)` from
// the HTTP handler, and both writes commit before either restart goroutine
// gets to load workspace_secrets. If the second goroutine arrives while the
// first holds the mutex, TryLock returns false and the second is silently
// skipped. The first goroutine's loadWorkspaceSecrets ran before the second
// write committed, so the new container boots without that env var. Surfaced
// as the "No LLM provider configured" hermes error when MODEL_PROVIDER landed
// after the API-key write but lost its restart to the mutex.
//
// The fix is the pending-flag / coalescing pattern: any restart request that
// arrives while one is in flight sets the pending flag and returns. The
// in-flight runner, on completion, checks the flag and runs another cycle.
// This collapses N concurrent requests into at most 2 sequential restarts
// (the current one + one more that picks up everything written during it),
// while guaranteeing the final container always sees the latest secrets.

// Each workspace gets its own *sync.Mutex on first use (sync.Map
// LoadOrStore is the standard "map of locks" pattern — every workspace
// that ever restarted keeps a tiny mutex in this map for the process
// lifetime; if memory ever becomes a concern we can prune on workspace
// removal, but workspace counts are small enough that it's a non-issue).
//
// The gate is intentionally separate from the existing `restartState`
// (coalesceRestart) and the RestartDebounceWindow self-fire debounce:
//   - restartState coalesces: collapses N rapid concurrent RestartByID
//     calls into ≤2 sequential cycles (the in-flight one + one drain).
//   - RestartDebounceWindow self-fire: drops successive RestartByID
//     calls within 60s of the most recent cycle start (closes the
//     probe-during-EC2-pending self-fire loop).
//   - restartProvisionGate (THIS): the load-bearing exclusion that
//     makes "only ONE Docker create per ws-<id> at a time" hold across
//     the TWO different entry points (manual Restart HTTP + programmatic
//     RestartByID). The existing two gates only cover the RestartByID
//     path; the manual Restart HTTP handler bypassed both and called
//     RestartWorkspaceAutoOpts directly.
//
// Both RestartWorkspaceAutoOpts and runRestartCycle acquire this gate
// around their Stop+Start pair. A concurrent caller blocks (Go mutex
// semantics) until the in-flight cycle completes — so the second
// caller's Stop+Start runs AFTER the first's Start is fully done, and
// the second's provisioner.Start is the only one in flight at a time.
// The HTTP UX cost: a user double-clicking Restart gets a delayed
// response on the second click (the second Stop+Start waits). That's
// strictly better than the pre-fix behavior where the second click
// wedged the workspace to "failed".
