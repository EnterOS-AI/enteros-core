// model_registry_validation.go — only-registered (runtime, model) validation
// at the create/config API (internal#718 P2-B item 3, CTO 2026-05-27
// "only registered providers/models selectable").
//
// The registry (internal/providers) is the SSOT for which models a runtime
// natively exposes (ModelsForRuntime). This validator rejects a (runtime, model)
// the registry does NOT recognize — but ONLY for a runtime the registry knows
// about. For a runtime absent from the first-party registry (langgraph,
// external, kimi, mock, or a future federated third-party runtime), it fails
// OPEN: the registry can't speak to that runtime's model set, so the existing
// knownRuntimes gate stays authoritative and this validator does not block.
// This is the federation-ready contract — first-party runtimes are gated against
// the registry; everything else passes through unchanged (no behavior change for
// non-registry runtimes).
