	// #4147: a DIAL-refused error on a container we can POSITIVELY confirm is
	// alive means the agent process inside it is (re)starting — e.g. a
	// config.yaml PUT restarts the agent while the workspace row still reads
	// status=online with a cached URL. That is a settling window, not a dead
	// agent, and it takes the SAME enqueue-and-drain path as a busy agent:
	// queue the message, drain it on the next heartbeat once the agent is
	// listening again. Before this, ECONNREFUSED matched none of
	// isUpstreamBusyError's shapes (DeadlineExceeded / Canceled / EOF /
	// "connection reset") and fell through to the terminal 502 below, LOSING
	// the message.
	//
	// The liveness guard is load-bearing, NOT a formality: dead==false does not
	// mean "alive". maybeMarkContainerDead early-returns dead=false for an
	// external-like runtime (we don't own that compute) and when no provisioner
	// is configured (we cannot look) — there it means UNKNOWN. Firing the
	// restart branch on "unknown" would silently queue messages to a
	// permanently-dead agent forever instead of surfacing the honest 502.
	// A restart has TWO transport shapes, and which one the caller sees is a race
	// with the agent's teardown:
	//
	//	listener already gone            -> dial refused        -> ECONNREFUSED
	//	listener accepts, then the
	//	process dies mid-request         -> connection closes   -> EOF / reset
	//
	// Both are the SAME event (the canonical trigger is a config.yaml PUT, which
	// restarts the agent). #4175 barred the enqueue for the ECONNREFUSED shape
	// only, so the EOF shape kept falling through to isUpstreamBusyError — which
	// matches "EOF" and "connection reset" — and got ENQUEUED into a drain that is
	// heartbeat-gated and therefore cannot fire while the agent is still coming up.
	// That is staging run 487314 ("A2A parent queue poll timed out"), and it is why
	// the identical code passed on run 487386: pure timing.
	//
	// Reclassifying EOF does NOT weaken real backpressure. A genuinely busy agent
	// does not drop the connection — the runtime returns a structured busy
	// RESPONSE when its inbox is at capacity (runtime_inbox.py: "caller should emit
	// a busy backpressure response"). A closed connection means the process went
	// away, not that it is working. Deadline/Canceled stay in the busy class, so a
	// slow-but-alive turn still enqueues exactly as before.
	//
	// Both shapes remain gated on containerLivenessIsVerifiable: "not dead" must
	// not be confused with "unknown". For an external-like runtime, or with no
	// provisioner to ask, we cannot tell a restart from a corpse, and the honest

		// #1684 / Reno Stars: native_session adapters previously took a
		// 503-no-enqueue path here, on the assumption that the SDK owned
		// an inbound queue and the platform a2a_queue would double-buffer.
		// In practice, the common native_session SDKs (claude-agent-sdk,
		// codex app-server, hermes-agent) do NOT have an inbound queue —
		// new turns can only be pushed via the same HTTP POST that just
		// returned busy. So cron fires (and any A2A retry) bounce 503
		// every tick until the SDK voluntarily yields. Reno Stars #1684
		// observed 12 consecutive `*/30` cron fires lost over 6h while a
		// single native_session held the slot.
		//
		// The original concern — "drain timing has no relationship to SDK
		// readiness" — turns out to be unfounded: heartbeat→drain is
		// gated by `payload.ActiveTasks < maxConcurrent` in
		// registry.go:Heartbeat, so drain only fires when the workspace
		// itself reports spare capacity. That IS the session-ended
		// signal. The native_session SDK reports ActiveTasks=1 while in a
		// turn, ActiveTasks=0 when idle, and the next heartbeat after
		// idle triggers DrainQueueForWorkspace.
		//
		// So we collapse the two branches: both native_session and
		// non-native callers enqueue here. The native_session SDK's own
		// in-flight POST stays unaffected; the queued item drains on the
		// next post-idle heartbeat.
		// #4147 follow-up (staging run 486390): a RESTARTING agent must NOT be
		// enqueued — it takes the retryable 503 below instead.
		//
		// Enqueue is right for a BUSY agent: it is mid-turn, and heartbeat-gated
		// drain (registry.go Heartbeat, ActiveTasks < maxConcurrent) fires only
		// once that turn ends, so the queued item lands on an IDLE agent.
		//
		// A restarting agent breaks that assumption. A freshly-booted agent
		// reports ActiveTasks=0 while it is still producing its own FIRST turn,
		// so the drain dispatches into that boot turn and the queue captures the
		// BOOT TURN'S output as the item's response_body. Staging saw exactly
		// that: the A2A ping was queued, drained, and answered with
		//   "Workspace restarted and ready. LLM_PROVIDER and MODEL env vars are
		//    now available. What would you like me to help with?"
		// instead of the requested PONG. A wrong answer is worse than a loud
		// retry — the caller cannot tell it was not answered.
		//
		// The 503 below carries "workspace agent restarting", which the A2A
		// callers already treat as a bounded-retry settling class (the same
		// class as "not publicly routable" / "provisioning"). That is all #4147
		// ever needed: the ORIGINAL bug was that ECONNREFUSED surfaced as
		// {"error":"failed to reach workspace agent"} — a body matching NO
		// retryable pattern — so callers gave up after one attempt. Fixing the
		// classification is sufficient; routing into the queue was not.

// failure mode that hid the ce2db75f regression for 5 days is now
// propagated instead of silently swallowed — a CONTEXT error
// (context.Canceled / context.DeadlineExceeded). Under ce2db75f the
// detached delegation goroutine ran on a cancelled request context, every
// `SELECT delivery_mode` failed `context canceled`, this function returned
// push, the poll-mode short-circuit in proxyA2ARequest was skipped, and
// poll-mode peers (e.g. an operator laptop on molecule-mcp-claude-channel)
// silently never got their a2a_receive inbox row. A transient,
// systematic-once-triggered context cancellation became permanent
// invisible misrouting. Returning that error lets the caller fail loud
// (mark the delegation failed) instead of mis-dispatching.
//
// Scope is deliberately narrow: only ctx errors propagate. Other DB
// errors retain the long-standing documented "fall back to push (today's
// synchronous behavior)" contract — that path is loud + recoverable
// (502 / SSRF reject / restart), unlike the silent poll-mode drop, and

// push (the safe synchronous default): sql.ErrNoRows, a NULL/empty column,
